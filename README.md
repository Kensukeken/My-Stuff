This is a project that includes implementations of various algorithms and data structures in TeX, C#, C++, and Python. <br/>

## TeX
The TeX folder contains documentation and notes on the algorithms and data structures implemented in the project. The documentation is written in LaTeX using the TeX typesetting system.

## C#
The C# folder contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in C#. The implementations are organized into separate files for each algorithm or data structure.

## C++
The C++ folder contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in C++. The implementations are organized into separate files for each algorithm or data structure.

## Python
The Python folder contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in Python. The implementations are organized into separate files for each algorithm or data structure.

## Getting Started
To run the implementations, you will need the following:

A TeX distribution, such as TeX Live, for compiling the documentation.
A C# compiler, such as Visual Studio, for compiling the C# implementations.
A C++ compiler, such as GCC, for compiling the C++ implementations.
A Python interpreter, such as Python 3, for running the Python implementations.
To compile the documentation, navigate to the TeX folder and run pdflatex <document>.tex.

To compile the C# implementations, navigate to the C# folder and run csc <file>.cs.

To compile the C++ implementations, navigate to the C++ folder and run g++ <file>.cpp.

To run the Python implementations, navigate to the Python folder and run python <file>.py.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow the standard GitHub workflow of forking the repository and creating a pull request with your changes. Please ensure that your code follows the existing code style and is well-documented.
