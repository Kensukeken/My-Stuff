## Introduction

This repository contains various implementations of algorithms and data structures in C#, C++, Python and TeX. The repository also includes documentation and notes on the algorithms and data structures implemented in the project. The documentation is written in LaTeX using the TeX typesetting system.

## Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:

- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - Programming language for developing .NET applications.
- [C++](https://isocpp.org/) - General-purpose programming language.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - High-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
- [TeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) - Typesetting system used for creating technical and scientific documents.

## Getting Started

To run the implementations, you will need the following:

- A TeX distribution, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), for compiling the documentation.
- A C# compiler, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/), for compiling the C# implementations.
- A C++ compiler, such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), for compiling the C++ implementations.
- A Python interpreter, such as [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), for running the Python implementations.

To compile the documentation, navigate to the TeX folder and run `pdflatex <filename>.tex`.

To compile the C# implementations, navigate to the C# folder and run `csc <filename>.cs`.

To compile the C++ implementations, navigate to the C++ folder and run `g++ <filename>.cpp`.

To run the Python implementations, navigate to the Python folder and run `python <filename>.py`.
