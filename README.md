# Algorithms and Data Structures in Multiple Languages
This project contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in TeX, C#, C++, Python, and JavaScript, along with documentation and notes.

## Technologies
- C# - Programming language for developing .NET applications.
- C++ - General-purpose programming language.
- Python - High-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
- JavaScript - High-level programming language often used for web development.
- TeX - Typesetting system used for creating technical and scientific documents.

## Getting Started
To run the implementations, you will need the following:
- A TeX distribution, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), for compiling the documentation.
- A C# compiler, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/), for compiling the C# implementations.
- A C++ compiler, such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), for compiling the C++ implementations.
- A JavaScript runtime, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), for running the JavaScript implementations.
- A Python interpreter, such as [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), for running the Python implementations.

To compile the documentation, navigate to the TeX folder and run `pdflatex <filename>.tex`.

To compile the C# implementations, navigate to the C# folder and run `csc <filename>.cs`.

To compile the C++ implementations, navigate to the C++ folder and run `g++ <filename>.cpp`.

To run the JavaScript implementations, navigate to the JavaScript folder and run `node <filename>.js`.

To run the Python implementations, navigate to the Python folder and run `python <filename>.py`.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow the standard GitHub workflow of forking the repository and creating a pull request with your changes. Please ensure that your code follows the existing code style and is well-documented.
